# Motivation
Basically if you need the document, that's in each directories or commet in config file.
The reason why this README is here that `renovate` just allow 'strict' json config.
# Renovate
Renovate works module manage that runs as watching latest version and suggestion updating packages.
Right now, this project set basic configuration and these links are probably helpful for you:
- [Renovateおすすめ設定 - hesma2’s blog](https://hesma2.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/04/10/134148)
- [hatena/renovate-config: A shareable config preset for Renovate used in Hatena.](https://github.com/hatena/renovate-config)

Maybe, you should consider to use something preset and move to under `.github` directory. I'm not sure the best practice for monorepo.
